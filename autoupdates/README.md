## üß∞ Overview 
_This space tells us about a possibility to auto update the source version using "uscan"._

## ‚ú® Issue

Problem: We have repositories with pinned versions of upstream packages. We need to have an overview of which packages will be auto-updated and which will go against a specific version with no auto-update. https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux/issues/2452 


## üöÄ Identification

https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agardenlinux%20path%3Aprepare_source%20branch&type=code
Above are the packages which has pinned versions of the package to pull from upstream url's


## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution

 * A tool "uscan" fetches the upstream source to compare newer versions compared to the current one
 * Requisites for uscan
   *  debian/watch 
     * Specific arguments passed to uscan specifying options (git), url, version/tags regex to match fetching the newer release
   *  debian/changelog
     *  Formatted header with current version which uscan reads and compares from upstream/source

**Working ::** 
   - The shell script creates a temporary directory in /tmp independent of the production space
   - Execution works with passing the package name as first argument 
   - Forks the git repo of the package with corresponding repo URL/package names
   - Evaluates the Current_Version of the package from prepare_source file from the package repo.
   - This consists of fetching the current revision from various patterns in prepare_source like "version=", "version_orig"=, "git src --branch" etc
   - Creates debian directory and changelog file for uscan environment in /tmp/work/PACKAGE-TIMESTAMP/ directory
   - Watch file stays customised for each package in the managed repository
   - Uscan executes with customised watch and debiaan/changelog to determine the availability of new version
   - If no new version found, exits, else if a newer version is found, then edits the prepare_source file with new version determined from uscan run.
